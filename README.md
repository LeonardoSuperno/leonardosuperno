## 🚀 Projects

### 🚗 [Real-time Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation](https://github.com/LeonardoSuperno/SemSeg_MLDL25)
- **Description:** This work focuses on domain adaptation techniques for real-time semantic segmentation. We trained and evaluated a classical model (DeepLabV2) and a real-time model (BiSeNet) on the real-world Cityscapes dataset to establish baseline performance. We then trained BiSeNet on the synthetic GTA5 dataset and evaluated its generalization to Cityscapes, highlighting the impact of domain shift.

### 🏥 [The Integrated Healthcare Timetabling Competition with Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/LeonardoSuperno/IhtcGA)
- **Description:** This project tackles the Integrated Healthcare Timetabling problem, which combines surgical case planning, patient admission scheduling, and nurse-to-room assignment. We developed a solution based on a **genetic algorithm** to efficiently manage hospital scheduling.
